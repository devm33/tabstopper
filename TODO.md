## All

- add second rules list that allows dupes ignore to be ignored up to #?=
    - i.e. the page action is not shown

- change dropdown for #?= to slider to show relative strictness

## Popup

- BUG if close setting is true, tabs are not closing

- on popup if close setting is not the default display second checkbox prompting
  to save as new default (action saved on click or on check?)

- collapse rules section of popup by default
    - e.g. open when clicking on a link to the effect of "Automatically
      close urls matching this..."

## Options

- maybe: autofocus edit url on click ?
